Before running the program, make sure that all of the script processes are killed by running
./killProcesses.sh

The program starts by running
./start.sh

Execution process:

start.sh sends mouse to a random location and sends listy to listy_location and starts cordy at localhost.

Cordy starts with sending Catty and Jazzy to nodes in ukkonodes file, starting from the beginning of ukkonodes file.
Then Cordy starts to wait for listy to write commands in cmsg.
Cats report of their situation to the cmsg.
Cordy gives commands so that if the mouse is not found, it puts a cat into the next node in ukkonodes file.
If a command is empty, it means that all of the ukkonodes have been visited. Cordy will put a cat to the first ukkonode just to do something.
If a mouse is found, Cordy puts the other mouse to the place where the mouse was found.
When both cats have found the mouse, Cordy gives attack command to one of the cats.
Attacking cat sends MEOW message to the mouse and the mouse sends SIGNINT to the cat.
